Usually, to use a module in a file, the basic syntax you need at the top of that file is:

from module_name import object_name

One common library that comes as part of the Python Standard Library is

datetime
. datetime helps you work with dates and times in Python.

Let’s get started by importing and using the datetime module. In this case, you’ll notice that datetime is both the name of the library and the name of the object that you are importing.

# Import datetime from datetime below:
from datetime import datetime
current_time = datetime.now()
print(current_time)

import random

We’ll work with two common random functions:

    Preview: Docs Returns a random item chosen from an iterable argument, such as a list or a dictionary.
    random.choice()
    which takes a list as an argument and returns a number from the list
    Preview: Docs Loading link description
    random.randint()
    which takes two numbers as arguments and generates a random number between the two numbers you passed in

# Import random below:
import random

# Create random_list below:
random_list = [random.randint(1, 101) for i in range(101)]

# Create randomer_number below:
randomer_number =  random.choice(random_list)

# Print randomer_number below:
print(randomer_number)
