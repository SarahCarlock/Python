#Boolean = true or False
#Relational Operators: == & !=
True and False must be capitalized
    1 == 1     # True

    2 != 4     # True

    3 == 5     # False

    '7' == 7   # False

statement_one = True
statement_two = False
statement_three = True
# Bool types
    True and False
    Boolean variables can be created in several ways. The easiest way is to simply assign True or False to a variable:

    set_to_true = True
    set_to_false = False

    You can also set a variable equal to a boolean expression.

    bool_one = 5 != 7 
    bool_two = 1 + 1 != 2
    bool_three = 3 * 3 == 9

    These variables now contain boolean values, so when you reference them they will only return the True or False values of the expression they were assigned.

    print(bool_one)    # True

    print(bool_two)    # False

    print(bool_three)  # True

    #EXAMPLE:
    my_baby_bool ="true"
    print(type(my_baby_bool))
    my_baby_bool_two = True
    print(type(my_baby_bool_two))

# If Statements Examples
if is_raining:
  print("bring an umbrella")

if 2 == 4 - 2: 
  print("apple")
#Examples!
    # Enter a user name here, make sure to make it a string
    user_name = "angela_catlady_87"

    if user_name == "Dave":
    print("Get off my computer Dave!")

    if user_name == "angela_catlady_87":
    print("Iknow it is you, Dave! Go away!")

#Relational Operators II

#Example
x = 20
y = 20

# Write the first if statement here:
if x == y:
  print("These numbers are the same")


credits = 120

# Write the second if statement here:

    > greater than
    >= greater than or equal to
    < less than
    <= less than or equal to

if credits >= 120:
  print("You have enough credits to graduate!")

#Boolean Operators
and, or, not
and combines two boolean expressions and evaluates as True if both its components are True, but False otherwise.

#Example 
statement_one = (2 + 2 + 2 >= 6) and (-1 * -1 < 0)


statement_two = (4 * 2 <= 8) and (7 - 1 == 6)

credits = 120
gpa = 3.4

if (credits >= 120 and (gpa >= 2.0)):
  print("You meet the requirements to graduate!")

#Example 
statement_one = (2 - 1 > 3) or (-5 * 2 == -10)

statement_two = (9 + 5 <= 15) or (7 != 4 + 3)

credits = 118
gpa = 2.0

if (credits >= 120) or (gpa >= 2.0):
  print("You have met at least one of the requirements.")

#Example 
statement_one = False
#not (4 + 5 <= 9)
statement_two = True
# not (8 * 2) != 20 - 4
credits = 120
gpa = 1.8

if (not credits >= 120):
  print("You do not have enough credits to graduate.")
if (not gpa >= 2.0):
  print("Your GPA is not high enough to graduate.")
if (not credits >= 120) and (not gpa >= 2.0):
  print("You do not meet either requirement to graduate!")

# Else statements 
credits = 120
gpa = 1.9

if (credits >= 120) and (gpa >= 2.0):
  print("You meet the requirements to graduate!")
else:
  print("You do not meet the requirements to graduate.")

# Else if statements / elif 
print("Thank you for the donation!")

if donation >= 1000:
  print("You've achieved platinum status")
elif donation >= 500:
  print("You've achieved gold donor status")
elif donation >= 100:
  print("You've achieved silver donor status")
else:

#Example 
grade = 86

if (grade >= 90):

elif (grade >= 80):
  print("B")
elif (grade >= 70):
