Once you have a dictionary, you can access the values in it by providing the key. For example, let’s imagine we have a dictionary that maps buildings to their heights, in meters:

building_heights = {"Burj Khalifa": 828, "Shanghai Tower": 632, "Abraj Al Bait": 601, "Ping An": 599, "Lotte World Tower": 554.5, "One World Trade": 541.3}

Then we can access the data in it like this:

print(building_heights["Burj Khalifa"]) # Prints 828
print(building_heights["Ping An"]) # Prints 599

example
zodiac_elements = {"water": ["Cancer", "Scorpio", "Pisces"], "fire": ["Aries", "Leo", "Sagittarius"], "earth": ["Taurus", "Virgo", "Capricorn"], "air":["Gemini", "Libra", "Aquarius"]}
print(zodiac_elements["earth"])
print(zodiac_elements["fire"])

Let’s say we have our dictionary of building heights from the last exercise:

building_heights = {"Burj Khalifa": 828, "Shanghai Tower": 632, "Abraj Al Bait": 601, "Ping An": 599, "Lotte World Tower": 554.5, "One World Trade": 541.3}

What if we wanted to know the height of the Landmark 81 in Ho Chi Minh City? We could try:

print(building_heights["Landmark 81"])

But "Landmark 81" does not exist as a key in the building_heights dictionary! So this will throw a KeyError:

KeyError: 'Landmark 81'

One way to avoid this error is to first check if the key exists in the dictionary:

key_to_check = "Landmark 81"

if key_to_check in building_heights:
  print(building_heights["Landmark 81"])

This will not throw an error, because key_to_check in building_heights will return False, and so we never try to access the key.

EXAMPLE 
zodiac_elements = {"water": ["Cancer", "Scorpio", "Pisces"], "fire": ["Aries", "Leo", "Sagittarius"], "earth": ["Taurus", "Virgo", "Capricorn"], "air":["Gemini", "Libra", "Aquarius"]}

zodiac_elements["energy"] = "Not a Zodiac element"

#if "energy" in zodiac_elements:
  #print(zodiac_elements["energy"])

print(zodiac_elements['energy'])

We saw in the last exercise that we had to add a key:value pair to a dictionary in order to avoid a KeyError. This solution is not sustainable. We can’t predict every key a user may call and add all of those placeholder values to our dictionary!

Dictionaries have a .get() method to search for a value instead of the my_dict[key] notation we have been using. If the key you are trying to .get() does not exist, it will return None by default:

building_heights = {"Burj Khalifa": 828, "Shanghai Tower": 632, "Abraj Al Bait": 601, "Ping An": 599, "Lotte World Tower": 554.5, "One World Trade": 541.3}

#this line will return 632:
building_heights.get("Shanghai Tower")

#this line will return None:
building_heights.get("My House")

You can also specify a value to return if the key doesn’t exist. For example, we might want to return a building height of 0 if our desired building is not in the dictionary:

print(building_heights.get('Shanghai Tower', 0)) # Prints 632
print(building_heights.get('Mt Olympus', 0)) # Prints 0
print(building_heights.get('Kilimanjaro', 'No Value')) # Prints 'No Value'

EXAMPLE
user_ids = {"teraCoder": 100019, "pythonGuy": 182921, "samTheJavaMaam": 123112, "lyleLoop": 102931, "keysmithKeith": 129384}

tc_id = user_ids.get("teraCoder")
print(tc_id)

stack_id = user_ids.get("superStackSmash", 100000)
print(stack_id)

Delete a Key

Sometimes we want to get a key and remove it from the dictionary. Imagine we were running a raffle, and we have this dictionary mapping ticket numbers to prizes:

raffle = {223842: "Teddy Bear", 872921: "Concert Tickets", 320291: "Gift Basket", 412123: "Necklace", 298787: "Pasta Maker"}

When we get a ticket number, we want to return the prize and also remove that pair from the dictionary, since the prize has been given away. We can use .pop() to do this. Just like with .get(), we can provide a default value to return if the key does not exist in the dictionary:

print(raffle.pop(320291, "No Prize"))
# Prints "Gift Basket"
print(raffle)
# Prints {223842: "Teddy Bear", 872921: "Concert Tickets", 412123: "Necklace", 298787: "Pasta Maker"}
print(raffle.pop(100000, "No Prize"))
# Prints "No Prize"
print(raffle)
# Prints {223842: "Teddy Bear", 872921: "Concert Tickets", 412123: "Necklace", 298787: "Pasta Maker"}
print(raffle.pop(872921, "No Prize"))
# Prints "Concert Tickets"
print(raffle)
# Prints {223842: "Teddy Bear", 412123: "Necklace", 298787: "Pasta Maker"}

.pop() works to delete items from a dictionary, when you know the key value.

EXAMPLE
available_items = {"health potion": 10, "cake of the cure": 5, "green elixir": 20, "strength sandwich": 25, "stamina grains": 15, "power stew": 30}
health_points = 20

health_points += available_items.pop("stamina grains", 0)
health_points += available_items.pop("power stew", 0)
health_points += available_items.pop("mystic bread", 0)

print(available_items, health_points)

Sometimes we want to operate on all of the keys in a dictionary. For example, if we have a dictionary of students in a math class and their grades:

test_scores = {"Grace":[80, 72, 90], "Jeffrey":[88, 68, 81], "Sylvia":[80, 82, 84], "Pedro":[98, 96, 95], "Martin":[78, 80, 78], "Dina":[64, 60, 75]}

We want to get a roster of the students in the class, without including their grades. We can do this with the built-in

list()
function:

print(list(test_scores))
# Prints ["Grace", "Jeffrey", "Sylvia", "Pedro", "Martin", "Dina"]

Dictionaries also have a
Preview: Docs Loading link description
.keys()
method that returns a dict_keys object. A dict_keys object is a view object, which provides a look at the current state of the dictionary, without the user being able to modify anything. The dict_keys object returned by .keys() is a set of the keys in the dictionary. You cannot add or remove elements from a dict_keys object, but it can be used in the place of a list for iteration:

for student in test_scores.keys():
 print(student)

will yield:

Grace
Jeffrey
Sylvia
Pedro
Martin
Dina
