Function Syntax

As a refresher, function syntax looks like this:

def some_function(some_input1, some_input2):
  # … do something with the inputs …
  return output

For example, a function that returns the sum of the first and last elements of a given list might look like this:

def first_plus_last(lst):
  return lst[0] + lst[-1]

And this would produce output like:

>>> first_plus_last([1, 2, 3, 4])
5
>>> first_plus_last([8, 2, 5, -8])
0
>>> first_plus_last([-10, 2, 3, -4])
-14

1. First Three Multiples
# Write your first_three_multiples function here
def first_three_multiples(num):
  print(num * 1)
  print(num * 2)
  print(num * 3)
  return num * 3

# Uncomment these function calls to test your first_three_multiples function:
first_three_multiples(10)
# should print 10, 20, 30, and return 30
first_three_multiples(0)
# should print 0, 0, 0, and return 0

OR

def first_three_multiples(num):
  print(num)
  print(num * 2)
  print(num * 3)
  return num * 3

2. Tip 
# Write your tip function here:
def tip(total, percentage):
    return (total * percentage) / 100
# Uncomment these function calls to test your tip function:
print(tip(10, 25))
# should print 2.5
print(tip(0, 100))
# should print 0.0

OR 

def tip(total, percentage):
  tip_amount = (total * percentage) / 100
  return tip_amount

3. Bond, James Bond 
# Write your introduction function here:
def introduction(first_name, last_name):
  return last_name + ", " + first_name + " " + last_name
# Uncomment these function calls to test your introduction function:
print(introduction("James", "Bond"))
# should print Bond, James Bond
print(introduction("Maya", "Angelou"))
# should print Angelou, Maya Angelou

4. Dog Years
# Write your dog_years function here:
def dog_years(name, age):
  dog = str(age * 7)
  return name + ", you are " + dog + " years old in dog years."
# Uncomment these function calls to test your dog_years function:
print(dog_years("Lola", 16))
# should print "Lola, you are 112 years old in dog years"
print(dog_years("Baby", 0))
# should print "Baby, you are 0 years old in dog years"

OR 

def dog_years(name, age):
  return name+", you are "+str(age * 7)+" years old in dog years"

5. All Operations
# Write your lots_of_math function here:
def lots_of_math(a, b, c, d):
  print(a + b)
  print(c - d)
  print((a + b) * (c - d))
  return ((a + b) * (c - d)) % a
# Uncomment these function calls to test your lots_of_math function:
print(lots_of_math(1, 2, 3, 4))
# should print 3, -1, -3, 0
print(lots_of_math(1, 1, 1, 1))
# should print 2, 0, 0, 0

OR

def lots_of_math(a, b, c, d):
  first = a + b
  second = c - d
  third = first * second
  fourth = third % a
  print(first)
  print(second)
  print(third)
  return fourth
