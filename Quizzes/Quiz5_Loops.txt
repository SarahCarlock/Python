Answer
1
1
3
When the loop reaches the element 2, it passes to the next number before printing it.

Question 6
What would be the output of the following code:
Code

numbers = [2, 4, 6, 8]
for number in numbers:
  print("hello!")

Answer
hello! 5 times
The loop prints “hello!” for each of the 4 numbers in numbers.

Question 7
Which of these list comprehensions will create a list equal to desired_list?

desired_list = [-1, 0, 1, 2, 3]

Answer
[i-1 for i in range(5)]
range(5) will contain the numbers 0 through 4, and the list comprehension will contain each of 

Question 8
Fill in the code to loop over the list grouped_topics and print every element in the list.

grouped_topics = [["Algorithms", "Data Structures", "AI"], ["Linear Regression", "SQL"]]

Question 9
Which of these list comprehensions will create a list equal to desired_list?
Code

my_list = [5, 10, -2, 8, 20]
desired_list = [10, 8, 20]

Answer
[i for i in my_list if i > 5]
This will take the elements of my_list that are greater than 5, which are 10, 8, and 20.
