Code

combo_meals = {1: ["hamburger", "fries"], 2: ["hamburger", "fries", "soda"], 4: ["veggie burger", "salad", "soda"], 6: ["hot dog", "apple slices", "orange juice"]}
print(combo_meals.get(3, ["hamburger", "fries"]))

Question 2
What will the following code output?
Code

inventory = {"iron spear": 12, "invisible knife": 30, "needle of ambition": 10, "stone glove": 20, "the peacemaker": 65, "demonslayer": 50}

The value associated with the key "stone glove" is 20.

"Best Actress"
"Animated Feature"
This loop goes through each key in the dictionary and prints it.

Question 4

Code

oscars = {"Best Picture": "Moonlight", "Best Actor": "Casey Affleck", "Best Actress": "Emma Stone", "Animated Feature": "Zootopia"}

Code

inventory = {"iron spear": 12, "invisible knife": 30, "needle of ambition": 10, "stone glove": 20, "the peacemaker": 65, "demonslayer": 50}

print(12 in inventory)

Answer
False
This code checks for the existence of 12 as a key in the dictionary. Although it doesnâ€™t exist as a key, this code would still run.

Question 6
What will the following code output?
Code

combo_meals = {1: ["hamburger", "fries"], 2: ["hamburger", "fries", "soda"], 4: ["veggie burger", "salad", "soda"], 6: ["hot dog", "apple slices", "orange juice"]}

raffle = {223842: "Teddy Bear", 872921: "Concert Tickets", 320291: "Gift Basket", 412123: "Necklace", 298787: "Pasta Maker"}

raffle.pop(561721, "No Value")
print(raffle)


Answer
{223842: "Teddy Bear", 872921: "Concert Tickets", 320291: "Gift Basket", 412123: "Necklace", 298787: "Pasta Maker"}
no change
The command .pop() will try to remove the nonexistent key 561721 from the dictionary, so raffle will remain unchanged.

Question 8
What will the following code output?
Code

combo_meals = {1: ["hamburger", "fries"], 2: ["hamburger", "fries", "soda"], 4: ["veggie burger", "salad", "soda"], 6: ["hot dog", "apple slices", "orange juice"]}
print(combo_meals[3])

Answer
KeyError
There is no key:value pair in this dictionary with a key of 3, so this code will produce an error.
