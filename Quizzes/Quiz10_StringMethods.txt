Question 1
Given the poem (When You Are Old, by W. B. Yeats) saved as multiline string as shown in the code block, what code could we use to create a list that contains a string of each line in the poem?
Code

when_you_are_old = \
"""When you are old and grey and full of sleep,
And nodding by the fire, take down this book,
And slowly read, and dream of the soft look
Your eyes had once, and of their shadows deep;

How many loved your moments of glad grace,
And loved your beauty with love false or true,
But one man loved the pilgrim soul in you,
And loved the sorrows of your changing face;

And bending down beside the glowing bars,
Murmur, a little sadly, how Love fled
And paced upon the mountains overhead
And hid his face amid a crowd of stars."""

Answer
list_of_lines = when_you_are_old.split("\n")
Splitting this string at the escape sequence "\n", or newline, will produce a list of each line in the poem.

Question 2
Given the following block of code, what is stored in the string split_hairs?
Code
dirty_harry = "Go ahead, make my day."
split_hairs = dirty_harry.split("a")

Answer
["Go ", "he", "d, m", "ke my d", "y."]
The code will split the string dirty_harry at each instance of the letter "a" which results in this list of strings.

Question 3

Question 4
Given the list greeting = ["Hello", "my", "name", "is", "Earl"] what line of code would produce a string that contains `”Hello_my_name_is_Earl”.

Answer
"_".join(greeting)
this code will join each string in the list together with the character "_".

this string method capitalized each word in a string

Question 7
Consider the string user_name = ":::::::: Eloise :::::::::::". What line of code would clean this string and produce the string user_name_fixed = "Eloise"?

Answer
user_name_fixed = user_name.strip(":").strip()
This code will first strip the ":" characters from the string and will then strip the remaining whitespace from the string.
