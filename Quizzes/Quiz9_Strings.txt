Question 4
Which of the following expressions is False?

Answer
"s" in "watermelon"
There is no string "s" contained in the larger string "watermelon" so this expression returns False.

Answer
good_fruit[3]
This code will select the letter "p" from the string good_fruit.

Question 6
What character will be selected from the string cool_fruit = "watermelon" using the code cool_fruit[len(cool_fruit) - 2]?

Answer
"o"
string[len(string)-1] selects the last character of a string, so cool_fruit[len(cool_fruit) - 2] selects the second to last character of the string, "o".
