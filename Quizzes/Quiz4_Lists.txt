Question 1
Which of the following lines of code would slice the list ["b", "c"] from mylist:
Code

mylist = ["a", "b", "c", "d", "e"]
Answer
myList[1:3]
The element b has index 1 (because Python is zero-indexed), and the element c has index 2. This code selects starting at index 1 and up to, but not including, index 3.

Question 2
Which of the following lines of code will correctly sort mylist?

Answer
myList.sort()

Question 3
Which of the following code selects the last three elements of mylist?

Answer
myList[-3:]
We can use negative indexes to count backwards from the last element in a list.

Question 4
Which of the following would be generated by the code snippet?
Code

mylist = ["a", "b", "c", "d", "e", "f"]
print(mylist[2:5])

Answer
["c", "d", "e"]

Question 5
Which of the following commands will return the length of the list mylist?

Answer
len(mylist)

Question 6
Which list would be created by running this code?
Code

list(range(2, 14, 4))

Answer
[2, 6, 10]

Question 7
Which of the following would create a range object that starts at 3 and goes up to 15 (non-inclusive) in increments of 4? 

Answer
[2, 15, 4]

Question 8
Fill in the code that would allow us to remove the 5th element from the following list:

pizza_toppings = ["Cheese", "Pepperoni", "Garlic", "Pineapple", "Mushroom", "Prosciutto"]

Answer
pizza_toppings.pop(4)

Question 9
Which of the following lines of code would remove "Breakdancing" from the list olympic_sports.

olympic_sports = ["Hockey", "Swimming", "Fencing", "Volleyball", "Breakdancing"]

Answer
olympic_sports.pop()
.pop() will remove the last element from a list when it receives no parameter.

Question 10
Which of the following lines of code will tell us how many times "win" appears in the list game_results?

Answer
game_results.count("win")

Question 11
Complete the code to insert "Buffalo" into a list called animals as the 4th element?

Answer
animals.insert (3, "Buffalo")

Question 12
Which of the following lines of code will insert "Gus" as the middle element of the list friends?
Code

friends = ["Annabelle", "Greg", "Katya", "Sol"]

Answer
friends.insert(-2, "Gus")
This would insert "Gus" into the -2 index where "Katya" is currently at, thus putting him in the middle of the list.
