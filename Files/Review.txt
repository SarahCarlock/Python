Now you know all about files! You were able to:

    Open up file objects using
    Preview: Docs Loading link description
    open()
    and with.
    Read a file’s full contents using Python’s .read() method.
    Read a file line-by-line using
    Preview: Docs Loading link description
    .readline()
    and .readlines()
    Create new files by opening them in write-mode.
    Append to a file non-destructively by opening a file in append-mode.
    Apply all of the above to different types of data-carrying files including CSV and JSON!

EXAMPLE
with open('file.txt') as file_object:
  print(file_object.read())
