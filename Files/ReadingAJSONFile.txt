Reading a JSON File
7 min

CSV isn’t the only file format that Python has a built-in library for. We can also use Python’s file tools to read and write

JSON
. JSON, an abbreviation of JavaScript Object Notation, is a file format inspired by the programming language JavaScript. The name, like CSV is a bit of a misnomer — some JSON is not valid JavaScript (and plenty of JavaScript is not valid JSON).

JSON’s format is endearingly similar to Python dictionary syntax, and so JSON

might be easy to read from a Python developer standpoint. Nonetheless, Python comes with a json package that will help us parse JSON files into actual Python

dictionaries
. Suppose we have a JSON file like the following:

purchase_14781239.json

{
  'user': 'ellen_greg',
  'action': 'purchase',
  'item_id': '14781239',
}

to Clipboard

We would be able to read that in as a Python dictionary with the following code:

json_reader.py

import json

with open('purchase_14781239.json') as purchase_json:
  purchase_data = json.load(purchase_json)

print(purchase_data['user'])
# Prints 'ellen_greg'

to Clipboard

First we import the json package. We opened the file using our trusty

open()
command. Since we’re opening it in read-mode we just need to pass the file name. We save the file in the temporary variable purchase_json.

We continue by parsing purchase_json using json.load(), creating a Python dictionary out of the file. Saving the results into purchase_data means we can interact with it. We print out one of the values of the JSON file by keying into the purchase_data object.
Instructions

    Checkpoint 1 Enabled

    1.

    Let’s read a JSON file! Start by importing the json module.

Checkpoint 2 Step instruction is unavailable until previous steps are completed

2.

Open up the file message.json, saving the file object to the variable message_json.

Open the file in read-mode, without passing any additional arguments to open().
Checkpoint 3 Step instruction is unavailable until previous steps are completed

3.

Pass the JSON file object as an argument to json.load() and save the resulting Python dictionary as message.
Checkpoint 4 Step instruction is unavailable until previous steps are completed

4.

Print out message['text'].


EXAMPLE
import json

with open('message.json') as message_json:
  message = json.load(message_json)
  print(message['text'])
