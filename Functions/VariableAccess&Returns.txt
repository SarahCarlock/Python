Example of Scope

# This function will print a hardcoded count of how many locations we have.
def print_count_locations():
  print("There are 3 locations")

# This function will print the favorite locations
def show_favorite_locations():
  print("Your favorite locations are: " + favorite_locations)

favorite_locations = "Paris, Norway, Iceland"
print_count_locations()
show_favorite_locations()

# return
Functions can also return a value to the program so that this value can be modified or used later.

Returned function value = a result from a function store in a variable.

Example
current_budget = 3500.75

def print_remaining_budget(budget):
  print("Your remaining budget is: $" + str(budget))

print_remaining_budget(current_budget)

# Write your code below: 
def deduct_expense(budget, expense):
  return budget - expense

shirt_expense = 9
new_budget_after_shirt = deduct_expense(current_budget, shirt_expense)
print_remaining_budget(new_budget_after_shirt)

# Multiple Returns 

Example
weather_data = ['Sunny', 'Sunny', 'Cloudy', 'Raining', 'Snowing']

def threeday_weather_report(weather):
  first_day = " Tomorrow the weather will be " + weather[0]
  second_day = " The following day it will be " + weather[1]
  third_day = " Two days from now it will be " + weather[2]
  return first_day, second_day, third_day

This function takes in a set of data in the form of a list for the upcoming weekâ€™s weather. We can get our returned function values by assigning them to variables when we call the function:

monday, tuesday, wednesday = threeday_weather_report(weather_data)

print(monday)
print(tuesday)
print(wednesday)

example!
def top_tourist_locations_italy():
  first = "Rome"
  second = "Venice"
  third = "Florence"
  return first, second, third
  most_popular1, most_popular2, most_popular3 = top_tourist_locations_italy()
  print(most_popular1)
  print(most_popular2)
  print(most_popular3)
