Example
tshirt_price = 9.75
shorts_price = 15.50
mug_price = 5.99
poster_price = 2.00

# Write your code below:
max_price = max(tshirt_price, shorts_price, mug_price, poster_price)
print(max_price)
min_price = min(tshirt_price, shorts_price, mug_price, poster_price)
print(min_price)
rounded_price = round(tshirt_price, 1)
print(rounded_price)'
