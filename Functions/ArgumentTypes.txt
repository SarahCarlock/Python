In Python, there are 3 different types of arguments we can give a function.

    Positional arguments: arguments that can be called by their position in the function definition.
        def calculate_taxi_price(miles_to_travel, rate, discount):
            print(miles_to_travel * rate - discount )
        
        # 100 is miles_to_travel
        # 10 is rate
        # 5 is discount
        calculate_taxi_price(100, 10, 5)

    Keyword arguments: arguments that can be called by their name.
        calculate_taxi_price(rate=0.5, discount=10, miles_to_travel=100)

    Default arguments: arguments that are given default values.
        We can provide a default value to a parameter by using the assignment operator (=). This will happen in the function declaration rather than the function call. 
            def calculate_taxi_price(miles_to_travel, rate, discount = 10):
                print(miles_to_travel * rate - discount )

        When using a default argument, we can either choose to call the function without providing a value for a discount (and thus our function will use the default value assigned) or overwrite the default argument by providing our own: 

Example
# Write your code below:
def trip_planner(first_destination, second_destination, final_destination = "Codecademy HQ"):
  print("Here is what your trip will look like!")
  print("First, we will stop in " + first_destination + ", then " + second_destination + ", and lastly " + final_destination)

trip_planner("France", "Germany", "Denmark")
trip_planner("Denmark", "France", "Germany")
trip_planner(first_destination = "Iceland", final_destination = "Germany", second_destination = "India")
trip_planner("Brooklyn", "Queens")
