Negative indices count backward from the end of the string, so string_name[-1] is the last character of the string, string_name[-2] is the second last character of the string, etc.

Here are some examples:

favorite_fruit = 'blueberry'
print(favorite_fruit[-1])
# => 'y'

print(favorite_fruit[-2])
# => 'r'

print(favorite_fruit[-3:])
# => 'rry'

# STRINGS ARE IMMUTABLE

So far in this lesson, weâ€™ve been selecting characters from strings, slicing strings, and concatenating strings. Each time we perform one of these operations we are creating an entirely new string.

This is because strings are immutable. This means that we cannot change a string once it is created. We can use it to create other strings, but we cannot change the string itself.

This property, generally, is known as mutability. Data types that are mutable can be changed, and data types, like strings, that are immutable cannot be changed.

first_name = "Bob"
last_name = "Daily"

fixed_first_name = "R" + first_name[1:]
